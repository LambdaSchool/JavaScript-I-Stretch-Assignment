# JavaScript I

This project is designed to get you used to working with all of the concepts we cover during the first 2 days of JavaScript Fundamentals week.

## Project initialization

* `Fork and Clone` this repository and cd into it.
* Run the command `yarn install` to install needed node packages.
* **JUST** a _reminder_ this command runs a script on your machine based on the `package.json` file you have installed in your project. By running this command, you're telling your project to head over to `npm.org` and download all of the packages you need for this project.
  ## Instructions
* Please complete the project files in this order: `callbacks.js` `arrays.js` `objects.js` and finally `closure.js`.
* In each project file you'll see a series of problems to work through,.
* When you feel like you've completed the problem, be sure to run, `yarn test <file name>` to get see if your code works properly... and to check if you have any linting errors.
* Work until you have all of the tests passing.

## Running the tests

Example:

```
yarn test arrays

-> executes all of the tests in the `src/tests/arrays.tests.js file`

yarn test closure
-> executes all of the tests in the `src/tests/closure.tests.js file`
```

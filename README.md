# JavaScript I

This project is designed to get you used to working with all of the concepts we cover during the first 2 days of JavaScript Fundamentals week.

## Project initialization

Do not use any of the built in Javascript Array methods like .forEach .map etc. If you'd like feel free to reuse any of your functions along the way though! 

#### Fork and clone this repo.
* Clone this repository and navigate into it.
* Run the command `npm i` to install needed node packages.
* Run the command `npm test` to run the tests.
* Work through the files and make the tests pass.
* Suggested order: `callbacks.js`, `arrays.js`, `objects.js`, `closure.js`.
* Submit a pull request when you are finished and we will review your code.

* **JUST** a _reminder_ this command runs a script on your machine based on the `package.json` file you have installed in your project. By running this command, you're telling your project to head over to `npm.org` and download all of the packages you need for this project.
  ## Instructions
* This project is designed to carry over from JavaScript I through JavaScript II.
* Please complete the project files in this order: `callbacks.js` `arrays.js` `objects.js` and finally `closure.js`.
* In each project file you'll see a series of problems to work through,.
* When you feel like you've completed the problem, be sure to run, `npm test <file name>` to get see if your code works properly... and to check if you have any linting errors.
* Work until you have all of the tests passing.
  ## Running the tests
  Example:

```
npm test arrays

-> executes all of the tests in the `src/tests/arrays.tests.js file`

npm test closure
-> executes all of the tests in the `src/tests/closure.tests.js file`
```
>>>>>>> fixed some linting rules and updated some instructions. More to come.
>>>>>>> removed vars

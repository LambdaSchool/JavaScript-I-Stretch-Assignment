# JavaScript - I

* The point of these assignments is to take your knowledge of JavaScript and start putting into practice the principles learned throughout JavaScript I.

## Assignment Description

* Fork/Clone this repository.
* Complete all the exercises as described inside each assignment file.
* Use `console.log()` statements to check to see if your code does what it is supposed to do.
* To test your `console.log()` statements open up the index.html file found in the assignments folder and use the developer tools to view the console.  

**Note:**You could also run `node /assignments/<fileName>` and see what prints in your terminal.

* Once you finish the exercises in each file, commit your code, and push it to your fork. 

### Objects
To better understand objects, you really just need to write more of them. The [objects.js](assignments/objects.js) file contains several challenges centered around a theme of interns starting at a new job. The Human Resources team needs information about the new hires. Use your new found object skills answer vital questions for HR.

* Read the instructions found within the file carefully to finish the challenges. 
* Complete each challenge presented before moving on to Arrays.

### Arrays
The [arrays.js](assignments/arrays.js) assignment takes us through a large data set of used cars.  You have been asked to help a used car business with some customer requests based on their inventory.  Use for loops and arrays to solve their problems.

* Utilize the the array `inventory` to complete your challenges
* You are not permitted to use map, reduce, or filter to solve these problems.  Only use a basic for loop.
* Complete each challenge presented before moving on to stretch.

### Stretch

* [ ] Arrow Function Syntax - [Check out this awesome guide for ES6 arrow syntax](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/when-and-why-you-should-use-es6-arrow-functions-and-when-you-shouldnt-3d851d7f0b26). You will see more and more arrow functions as you progress deeper into JavaScript. Use the [stretch-function-conversion.js](assignments/stretch-function-conversion.js) file as a helper challenge to showcase some of the differences between ES5 and ES6 syntax.  

* Move on to tomorrow's content and start studying callbacks, write a few of your own to get the hang of it.
* Look at array methods like .map(), .reduce(), .filter(). use them on the data in the arrays assignment to accomplish the same things you did with the ES5 for loop.

# JavaScript I

## Project initialization

* `Fork and Clone` this repository and cd into it.
* Run the command `npm i` to install needed node packages.
<<<<<<< HEAD
* Run the command `npm test` to run the tests.
* Work through the files and make the tests pass.
* Suggested order: `callbacks.js`, `arrays.js`, `objects.js`, `closure.js`.
* Submit a pull request when you are finished and we will review your code.
>>>>>>> Initial commit
=======
* **JUST** a _reminder_ this command runs a script on your machine based on the `package.json` file you have installed in your project. By running this command, you're telling your project to head over to `npm.org` and download all of the packages you need for this project.
  ## Instructions
* This project is designed to carry over from JavaScript I through JavaScript II.
* Please complete the project files in this order: `variables.js` `callbacks.js` `arrays.js` `objects.js` and finally `closure.js`.
* In each project file you'll see a series of problems to work through,.
* When you feel like you've completed the problem, be sure to run, `npm test <file name>` to get see if your code works properly... and to check if you have any linting errors.
* Work until you have all of the tests passing.
  ## Running the tests
  Example:

```
npm test arrays

-> executes all of the tests in the `src/tests/arrays.tests.js file`

npm test closure
-> executes all of the tests in the `src/tests/closure.tests.js file`
```
>>>>>>> fixed some linting rules and updated some instructions. More to come.
